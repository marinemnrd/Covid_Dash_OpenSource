Our Covid-19 Dashboard was created in June 2021 by the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire (CRI),
University of Paris Masters students.

Here is the list of the contributors of this project:

   Paul Montecot Grall <paul.montecotgrall@cri-paris.org>
   Marine Menardin <marine.menardin@cri-paris.org>
   Elizabeth Afolabi <elizabeth.afolabi@cri-paris.org>

And a big thank you to Pierre Poulain for being an inspiring and down to earth teacher who always took his time
to explain everything in detail and made the class interesting especially with wooclap.

And another thank you to our fellow Master 1 Digital Science colleagues who were ready to help whenever we needed.
