# Covid_Dash_OpenSource
Creating an interactive Covid19 Dashboard for the OpenSource class

## Final result and data exploration features
Your dashboard should be interactive and allow the user to:
1. Select which countries to display (among a pre-defined list).
2. Select which time period to display.
3. Select which variable(s) to display: 
      1. number / cumulated number / 7-day rolling average of confirmed cases / deaths (recovered)
      2. Upon parameter selection, graphics should be updated dynamically.

4. You could also implement peak detection with the first numeric derivative.
