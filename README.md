# Covid_Dash_OpenSource
Creating an interactive Covid19 Dashboard for the OpenSource class

## Final result and data exploration features
Your dashboard should be interactive and allow the user to:
Select which countries to display (among a pre-defined list).
Select which time period to display.
Select which variable(s) to display: 
number / cumulated number / 7-day rolling average
of confirmed cases / deaths (recovered)
Upon parameter selection, graphics should be updated dynamically.

You could also implement peak detection with the first numeric derivative.
