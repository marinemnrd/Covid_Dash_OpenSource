Our Covid-19 Dashboard was created in June 2021 by the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire (CRI),
University of Paris Masters students.

Here is the list of the contributors of this project:

   Paul Montecot Grall <paul.montecotgrall@cri-paris.org>

And a big thank you to Pierre Poulain for being an inspiring and down to earth professor who always took his time
to explain in detail and made the class interesting.

And another thank you to our fellow Digital Science Master 1 colleagues who were ready to help whenever needed.
